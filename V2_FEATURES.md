## Testing Recommendations

### Export/Import Testing
1. Create several test cards
2. Export to file
3. Delete cards from app
4. Import from file
5. Verify all cards restored correctly
6. Try importing same file again (should skip duplicates)

### Search Testing
1. Add cards with different names and types
